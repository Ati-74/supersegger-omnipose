## Quick Start Guide for SuperSegger

- Using the GUI

1. Image directory: 

Paste the image directory into the input box, or use the folder icon to select the folder. 

2. Image requirements: 

Images should be monochromatic and .tif format. Images do not need to be a specific resolution, because Omnipose segmentation has been trained with various resolutions.

3. Image file naming: 

The file naming convention is `[somebasename]t[number]xy[number]c[number].tif` where the numbers after 't' are the time frames after 'xy' are for the different timelapse positions, and after 'c' are the different channels (c1 are the phase images, c2 onwards are the fluorescence channels), eg MG1655_t001xy1c1.tif.
The program can segment images for snapshots (i.e. if t is missing from the filename, [somebasename]xy[number]c[number].tif) or for one xy position (i.e. if xy is missing from the filename [somebasename]t[number]c[number].tif).

To rename images can be done with the GUI or with the function convertImageNames.m.
For the GUI:

1. Fill Basename with the desired identification of the images (suggested is date-strain).
2. Fill Channels with the corresponding channel names as identified in your original filenames, separated by a comma. The first entry should correspond to the phase image. (ie if the file names are MG1655_GFP.tif, MG1655_BF.tif, enter `BF,GFP`)
3. Fill Time prefix/suffix with a unique substring that precedes the number indicating the time frame in the filename (ie strain_t0001.tif would use prefix `t` or `_t` and suffix `.tif`)
4. Fill XY prefix/suffix similarly to the Time prefix/suffix.
5. The prefix/suffix can also be left blank (ex snapshots have a single time; a single XY)
6. Click 'Convert Image Names'

- Selecting constants

Since Omnipose segmentation has replaced Supersegger's, there is no further need to select specific segmentation constants. Note that segmentation [parameters](strain_0001t_BF. can be tested using the Omnipose GUI.

- Using processExp



- Channel alignment (for fluorescence)
